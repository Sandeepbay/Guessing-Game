Guessing Game 

I think the number that has to be guessed is random till the maximum number

Input - Ask for a maximum number

Input - enter your first guess - if its lesser than the number to be guessed it should say too low.
                               
					 - if the number is higher than that of the number it should display too high , try a lower number.    

					 - When we get the number that we found it should display a message which says IT TOOK YOU N GUESSES.  

PS - If u get bored of this game and u want it to end it abruptly , u have to press a certain key which will stop the game. 



Solution- 

As we dont know how much iteration has to be carried out we will be using while loop. 

We will be using the "break" option to end the game abruptly too.
